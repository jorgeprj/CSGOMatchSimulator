# CSGO Match Simulator
The idea of ​​the project is to create a simulator of counter strike matches with a graphical interface with html/css.

## Description
This project is an interactive simulator of a CS:GO match, where users can select teams and then start the simulation to see the results of the match. The project uses a simple *JSON* database with teams and players For the example, in the last release the following teams were used: **Furia Esports**, **Fluxo** and **Imperial Sports**.

### REALEASE 1.0

In this first version it is possible to choose between the 3 teams, **Furia Esports**, **Fluxo** and **Imperial Sports**, to simulate  completely random matches. Also, players appear when choosing the team.

The highlight is a complete overhaul of the visual design with enhanced CSS, providing a more immersive and stylized experience. Additionally, we've introduced the **player profile** system, allowing users to access detailed information about each match participant, including their *skills*, *complete name*, *age* and *country*.

Another valuable addition is the **match stats** feature, offering in-depth information about simulated matches, including the number of *kills*, *deaths*, and *ratings* for all players. This update also includes performance enhancements and bug fixes to ensure a stable and smooth experience. 

In addition to these exciting features, we've expanded our database to accommodate even more gaming enthusiasts. We've added four additional teams, totaling *seven teams* with a roster of *35 players*.
